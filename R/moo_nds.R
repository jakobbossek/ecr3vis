#' @description
#' Fast non-dominated sorting algorithm proposed by Deb et al.Â [1].
#' Non-dominated sorting expects a set of points and returns a
#' set of non-dominated fronts. In short words this is done as follows: the
#' non-dominated points of the entire set are determined and assigned rank 1.
#' Afterwards all points with the current rank are removed, the rank is increased
#' by one and the procedure starts again. This is done until the set is empty, i.~e.,
#' each point is assigned a rank.
#'
#' @note
#' This procedure is the key survival selection of the famous NSGA-II multi-objective
#' evolutionary algorithm.
