**NOTE:** __Under development!!!__ (It is likely that **ecr3vis** will be merged/renamed into **ecr3** in the course of development)


## Introduction

**ecr3vis** is the visualization module of **ecr3** (under development). It offers a collection of functions for the visualization of results of randomized search heuristics. The focus is on multi-objective problems. The package includes 2d- and 3d-scatter-plots, parallel coordinate plots (PCP), heatmaps etc.


## Example

In the following we demonstrate how to build a simple mutation-based EA to optimize the Pseudo-boolean function ONEMAX which counts the number of ones in a bistring of length n, i.e., the optimum is obviously the all-ones bit-string.
We first define the fitness function that guides the evolutionary search.
```r
library(ecr3vis)
library(tidyverse)

# import sample data-set
data(emoas_on_zdt)
tbl = filter(emoas_on_zdt, repl == 1L)

plot_scatter2d(tbl, colour = "algorithm")

# Add third objective
tbl$y3 = tbl$y2 + 1
plot_heatmap(tbl)
plot_radar(tbl[1:3, ])
plot_radar(tbl[1:3, ]) + facet_grid(. ~ nr)
```


## Development Team

The package is a one-man project by [Jakob Bossek](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/jakob.bossek) at the moment of writing. However, the package interfaces some neat implementations of various other people (see DESCRIPTION file for details).


## How to contribute?

You can contribute by identifing annoying bugs in the [issue tracker](http://github.com/jakobbossek/ecr3vis). This is also the preferred place to ask questions and raise feature requests. Moreover, users can contribute even more by [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the ecr3vis repository, implementing feautures or bugfixes and raising a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).


## Installation Instructions

The package will be available at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org) *when it is done*. If you are interested in trying out and playing around with the current github developer version use the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package and type the following command in R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jakobbossek/ecr3vis")
```

## Getting help

Please address questions and missing features about the *ecr3vis* as weell as annoying bug reports in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jakobbossek/ecr3vis/issues). Pay attention to explain your problem as good as possible. At its best you provide an example, so I can reproduce your problem quickly. Please avoid sending e-mails.
